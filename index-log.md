## Rev 3.22 — 2026-05-08

Cross-page consistency rollout (phase 1) — top-level navigation pages.

### What changed
- **4 files renamed for cleaner URLs:**
  - `planet-map.html` → `adao-lore.html`
  - `capa_lp_converter.html` → `ampcapa-tool.html`
  - `fuel_tracker.html` → `fuel-tool.html`
  - `dao_governance.html` → `dao.html`
- **Top nav now has 5 tabs** including a new Home tab (was 4 — Home now shows on every page including index)
- **Active page highlighting** — current page's tab gets cyan styling in both desktop top nav and mobile bottom nav
- All internal references in `index.html` and `tools.html` updated for the renamed files
- `sitemap.xml` rewritten to reflect current page list with new names

### Cross-page rollout (separate file pushes, listed here for visibility)
Four core tab pages now have unified header + 5-tab top nav + mobile bottom nav + footer + per-page changelog system, with their original page-specific controls preserved:
- `nft-explorer-index.html` — starting rev 4.12 (Collection/Wallet/Map view toggles preserved)
- `adao-lore.html` — starting rev 2.8 (galaxy map content preserved)
- `tla-stats.html` — starting rev 1.14 (epoch selector + all charts preserved)
- `dao.html` — starting rev 1.4 (Members/Proposals tabs + audit tool link preserved)

Each of those 4 pages fetches its own changelog: `explorer-log.md`, `lore-log.md`, `tla-log.md`, `dao-log.md`. All other pages (when added in a future rollout phase) will fetch `index-log.md` since most site-wide changes happen on the homepage anyway.

## Rev 3.21 — 2026-05-07

This revision consolidates a wide-ranging modernization of the dashboard. Major themes: SEO/PWA readiness, mobile redesign, more honest data display, navigation cleanup.

### SEO & discovery
- Added canonical URL, full Open Graph + Twitter Card meta tags, robots directive, theme-color
- Improved meta description (~150 chars)
- Sitemap rewritten — removed 7 dead pages, added 8 active ones, re-prioritized live dashboards

### PWA / install support
- `site.webmanifest` upgraded with categories, maskable icons, 3 quick-launch shortcuts
- App install instructions modal (iPhone / Android steps)
- App-launch default-page selector (only visible when running as installed app)
- Mobile bottom tab bar (Home / NFTs / Lore / TLA / DAO) — fixed-position, native-app feel, auto-highlights active page

### Navigation overhaul
- Top nav restructured to 4 equal-width tabs: NFT Explorer · aDAO Lore · TLA Stats · DAO
- Galaxy Map promoted out of dropdown to its own "aDAO Lore" tab
- Mobile labels shortened: Explorer · Lore · TLA · DAO
- DAO Home link fixed (removed `?url=...erisprotocol.com` query param)
- Top info-cards grid expanded to **9 tiles** with two new dropdown-style tiles:
  - **DAO Links** (Main DAO + Council DAO sections, 10 destinations)
  - **Contract** (NFT Contract + Contract Audit)
- ALLY Rewards displays as a tall tile spanning 2 rows on desktop, normal tile on mobile

### Honest data display
- Removed all "snapshot fallback" data — tiles no longer show stale values when fetches fail
- Replaced em-dashes and "stale data" text with consistent loading spinners
- Removed red snapshot indicator dot — tiles either show live data (green pulse dot) or a spinner
- Treasury tile only displays a value when ALL assets successfully priced
- TLA Deposits / TLA VP use epoch-based staleness check (not date-based)
- "Please Note" disclaimer banner removed (no longer needed)

### Mobile redesign
- Single coherent mobile CSS block (replaced ~370 lines of layered overrides)
- Top info-cards: 3-col grid on mobile, all 9 tiles uniform compact size
- Stat tiles: tighter padding, smaller fonts, chart icons no longer overlap titles
- Live Activity rows: 2-line layout (NFT info on row 1, price + time on row 2)
- Marketplace collection tabs: segmented control style with proper sizing
- Listings filter: replaced 3-button toggle with single-select dropdown using collection logos
- Mobile-only filter dropdowns for Condition + Marketplace (replaces inline button groups)
- CoinGecko ticker thinner on mobile
- Tile titles wrap to 2 lines instead of truncating with ellipsis
- Tile text properly centered (CSS specificity fix)

### Cleanup
- Removed dead pages from repo: `graphs.html`, `news.html`, `rampt.html`, `on-ramp.html`, `off-ramp.html`, `alliance-dao-docs.html`, `test-page.html`
- Removed `Logos` modal trigger from footer
- Removed yellow disclaimer banner
- Vercel domain redirects fixed to 308 permanent (`theadao.com`, `www.theadao.com` → `www.thealliancedao.com`)

### Footer additions
- Rev number + Changelog link added to footer (this changelog)
