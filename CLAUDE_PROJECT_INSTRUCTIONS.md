This project is for working on The Alliance DAO (aDAO) website at thealliancedao.com. The user is defipatriot, a council member of the DAO.

## At the start of every conversation

Fetch these three documents (in order) to load full project context. Don't ask permission — just do it:

1. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defipatriot/website-adao-core/main/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md — canonical project context: design principles, architecture, conventions, tracking responsibilities
2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thealliancedao/tla-core/main/docs/pending-changes/CHANGES_PENDING.md — the platform work queue (⚠ moved to the ORG repo 2026-07-14 per SPEC-docs-consolidation; data/capture-layer SPECs and `queries.md` live in `tla-core/docs/` too — never update old website-adao-core copies, they are deleted)
3. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defipatriot/website-adao-core/main/index-log.md — changelog of shipped revisions for the homepage

**Important:** Log files (`index-log.md`, `explorer-log.md`, `lore-log.md`, `tla-log.md`, `dao-log.md`) live at the **root** of `website-adao-core`, NOT in a `/logs/` subdirectory. Same for `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `site.webmanifest`, etc.

PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md has a "Tracking responsibilities" section near the top — read that carefully. You are expected to maintain these docs proactively as we work, not only when the user explicitly asks. The user has stated they will forget things, so logging decisions, future ideas, tech debt, and open questions falls on Claude.

## Repo setup

Main site repo: `github.com/defipatriot/aDAO-links-site`
Docs repo: `github.com/defipatriot/website-adao-core` (everything at root, no subdirs)
Image hosting repo: `github.com/defipatriot/aDAO-Image-Files`
Cron infrastructure repo: `github.com/defipatriot/cron-scripts` (12 production crons writing to `*-data_2026` data repos)

To work on the site, clone the main repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/defipatriot/aDAO-links-site /home/claude/aDAO-links-site
```

To work on a cron, clone the cron-scripts repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/defipatriot/cron-scripts /home/claude/cron-scripts
```

The user pushes commits between chats — always sync with `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/main` before making changes. **But** verify what's actually on origin/main matches recent work (the user occasionally has unpushed local edits in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` that you handed them last chat). When in doubt, ask before doing a hard reset.

## Workflow

Iterative, screenshot-driven UI work. Pattern: user pushes → user screenshots an issue → Claude diagnoses + edits → user pushes the fix → repeat.

The user does NOT have me push directly. I produce updated files in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`; the user downloads them and uploads via GitHub web UI. When generating multiple iterations of the same file in a session, mention which is the final version to push (browsers rename duplicates with `(1)`, `(2)`).

**Exported files must use the EXACT destination filename** — same name as the file being replaced (`nft-inventory.js`, `README.md`, `queries.md`), so the user can match it 1:1 to what they're overwriting. Never path-encode (`cron-scripts__nft-inventory__nft-inventory.js`) and never add `_v2`/`_final` suffixes. State the destination repo/path in chat text instead. If two same-named files would collide in one export, present them in separate batches.

## Current phase: Cross-page consistency rollout — Phase 2

Phase 1 (Rev 3.22 / 3.23) brought the 4 core tab pages — NFT Explorer, aDAO Lore, TLA Stats, DAO — into the unified chrome system. Phase 2 covers the remaining pages (info-card destinations, dropdown destinations, tools sub-pages). See `CHANGES_PENDING.md` for the prioritized task list and `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` "Cross-page consistency requirements" for the spec.

The reusable injection pattern from `/home/claude/inject_shared_chrome.py` (last chat) handles this efficiently — copy that script and update the `PAGES` array.

## Deployment

The site is on Vercel (auto-deploys on push to `main`). **Cron jobs run on Render**, not Vercel — they live in the `cron-scripts` repo, each subfolder deployed as an independent Render Cron Job that writes to its own `*-data_2026` GitHub repo. Don't suggest GitHub Actions or Vercel cron for new scheduled tasks unless there's a specific reason — the Render-cron pattern is the established convention. See `cron-scripts/README.md` for full architecture.

## Style

The user prefers concrete, focused responses. They push back on over-engineering and busy UIs. Don't add CSS/features that weren't asked for. When something's broken, find the actual root cause (often a CSS specificity conflict from layered prior fixes) rather than piling on `!important` flags.
